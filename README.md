# nodejs-dependency-injection-container
NodeJS simple DI container.

## Introduction

Based on tutorial of 200 LOC DIC from @Darcy Rayner. It pretends to:

- [ ] Early detection of circular references, (when you add your providers).
- [ ] Nested containers, add the ability to provide types from child containers, (similar to Angular/NestJs modules).
- [ ] Factories with injected parameters.
- [ ] Specifiy scope of instance lifecycle in providers, (eg. singleton).
